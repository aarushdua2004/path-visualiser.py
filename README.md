# BFS Path Visualizer

This project is a Breadth-First Search (BFS) path visualizer built using the Pygame library. The visualizer helps users understand the BFS algorithm by providing a graphical representation of how the algorithm explores nodes in a grid to find the shortest path from a start point to a goal.

## Features

- Interactive grid where users can set start, goal, and barrier nodes
- Real-time visualization of the BFS algorithm
- Ability to reset the grid and visualize again

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have Python and Pygame installed. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone (git URL)
    cd bfs-path-visualizer
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

## Usage

Run the main script to start the visualizer:

```bash
python (main script name).py
